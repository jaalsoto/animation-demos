Executive summary
=================

This project consists of golfed HTML5 canvas animations written with only 140
characters of JavaScript. 

The animations use the default shortcuts provided by Dwitter:

t: Elapsed time in seconds.
S: Shorthand for Math.sin.
C: Shorthand for Math.cos.
T: Shorthand for Math.tan.
R: Function that generates rgba-strings, usage ex.: R(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
c: A 1920x1080 canvas.
x: A 2D context for that canvas.

The code is placed within a function and called 60 times per second.
